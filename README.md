Description of the project :-
                                  This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images as either having a tumor or not. It involves preprocessing images, augmenting data to improve model generalization, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. A CNN model is built with multiple convolutional and fully connected layers, trained using augmented data, and validated on test data. The model predicts and visualizes results, indicating whether a tumor is detected in a given MRI image.
